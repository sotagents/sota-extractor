Dialogue acts are a type of speech acts (for Speech Act Theory, see [Austin (1975)](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674411524) and [Searle (1969)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/speech-acts/D2D7B03E472C8A390ED60B86E08640E7)).",

The dataset includes the audio files and the transcription files, as well as information about the speakers and the calls. The Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus (SwDA) [[download](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/swb1_dialogact_annot.tar.gz)] extends the Switchboard-1 corpus with tags from the [SWBD-DAMSL tagset](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/ws97/manual.august1.html), which is an augmentation to the Discourse Annotation and Markup System of Labeling (DAMSL) tagset. The 220 tags were reduced to 42 tags by clustering in order to improve the language model on the Switchboard corpus. A subset of the Switchboard-1 corpus consisting of 1155 conversations was used. The resulting tags include dialogue acts like statement-non-opinion, acknowledge, statement-opinion, agree/accept, etc. Annotated example: *Speaker:* A, *Dialogue Act:* Yes-No-Question, *Utterance:* So do you go to college right now?",

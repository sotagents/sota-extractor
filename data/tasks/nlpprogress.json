The process of building taxonomies is usually divided into two main steps: (1) extracting hypernyms for concepts, which may constitute a field of research in itself (see Hypernym Discovery below) and (2) refining the structure into a taxonomy.",

The dataset includes the audio files and the transcription files, as well as information about the speakers and the calls.\n\nThe Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus (SwDA) [[download](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/swb1_dialogact_annot.tar.gz)] extends the Switchboard-1 corpus with tags from the [SWBD-DAMSL tagset](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/ws97/manual.august1.html), which is an augmentation to the Discourse Annotation and Markup System of Labeling (DAMSL) tagset. The 220 tags were reduced to 42 tags by clustering in order to improve the language model on the Switchboard corpus. A subset of the Switchboard-1 corpus consisting of 1155 conversations was used. The resulting tags include dialogue acts like statement-non-opinion, acknowledge, statement-opinion, agree/accept, etc.  \nAnnotated example:  \n*Speaker:* A, *Dialogue Act:* Yes-No-Question, *Utterance:* So do you go to college right now?",

The dataset contains nine general semantic relations\ntogether with a tenth 'OTHER' relation.\n\nExample:\n > There were apples, **pears** and oranges in the **bowl**.\n\n `(content-container, pears, bowl)`\n\nThe main evaluation metric used is macro-averaged F1, averaged across the nine proper relationships (i.e. excluding the\nOTHER relation), taking directionality of the relation into account.\n\nSeveral papers have used additional data (e.g. pre-trained word embeddings, WordNet) to improve performance.

All supervised systems in the evaluation table are trained on SemCor. Some supervised methods, particularly neural architectures, usually employ the SemEval 2007 dataset as development set (marked by *). The most usual baseline is the Most Frequent Sense (MFS) heuristic, which selects for each target word the most frequent sense in the training data.\n\nKnowledge-based:  Knowledge-based systems usually exploit WordNet or [BabelNet](https://babelnet.org/) as semantic network. The first sense given by the underlying sense inventory (i.e. WordNet 3.0) is included as a baseline.\n\nThe main evaluation measure is F1-score.",

They only assess content selection and do not account for other quality aspects, such as fluency, grammaticality, coherence, etc. \n2. To assess content selection, they rely mostly on lexical overlap, although an abstractive summary could express they same content as a reference without any lexical overlap.\n3. Given the subjectiveness of summarization and the correspondingly low agreement between annotators, the metrics were designed to be used with multiple reference summaries per input. However, recent datasets such as CNN/DailyMail and Gigaword provide only a single reference.\n\nTherefore, tracking progress and claiming state-of-the-art based only on these metrics is questionable. Most papers carry out additional manual comparisons of alternative summaries. Unfortunately, such experiments are difficult to compare across papers.

The first dataset released contained only 10,000 sentence-compression pairs, but last year was released an additional 200,000 pairs. \n\nExample of a sentence-compression pair:\n> Sentence: Floyd Mayweather is open to fighting Amir Khan in the future, despite snubbing the Bolton-born boxer in favour of a May bout with Argentine Marcos Maidana, according to promoters Golden Boy\n\n> Compression: Floyd Mayweather is open to fighting Amir Khan in the future. \n\nIn short, this is a deletion-based task where the compression is a subsequence from the original sentence. From the 10,000 pairs of the eval portion([repository](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/sentence-compression/tree/master/data)) it is used the very first 1,000 sentence for automatic evaluation and the 200,000 pairs for training.\n\nModels are evaluated using the following metrics:\n* F1 - compute the recall and precision in terms of tokens kept in the golden and the generated compressions.\n* Compression rate (CR) - the length of the compression in characters divided over the sentence length. \n\n\n[Go back to the README](../README.md)",

However, many real-world question answering problems require the reading of text not because it contains the literal answer, but because it contains a recipe to derive an answer together with the reader's background knowledge. We formalise this task and introduce the challenging ShARC dataset with 32k task instances. \n\nThe goal is to answer questions by possibly asking follow-up questions first. We assume that the question does not provide enough information to be answered directly. However, a model can use the supporting rule text to infer what needs to be asked in order to determine the final answer. Concretely, The model must decide whether to answer with \"Yes\", \"No\", \"Irrelevant\", or to generate a follow-up question given rule text, a user scenario and a conversation history. Performance is measured with Micro and Macro Accuracy for \"Yes\"/\"No\"/\"Irrelevant\"/\"More\" classifications, and the quality of follow-up questions are measured with BLEU.\n\nThe public data, further task details and public leaderboard are available on the [ShARC Website](https://sharc-data.github.io/).",

This removes the over-reliance of current approaches on answer-options and forces them to decide on the correctness of each candidate answer independently of others. In other words, unlike previous work, the task here is not to simply identify the best answer-option, but to evaluate the correctness of each answer-option individually.\n - The correct answer(s) is not required to be a span in the text.\n - The paragraphs in our dataset have diverse provenance by being extracted from 7 different domains such as news, fiction, historical text etc., and hence are expected to be more diverse in their contents as compared to single-domain datasets.\n\nThe leaderboards for the dataset is available on the [MultiRC website](http://cogcomp.org/multirc/).",

[Named Entity Recognition](named_entity_recognition.md)) and disambiguating (Named Entity Disambiguation) named entities to a knowledge base (e.g. Wikidata, DBpedia, or YAGO). It is sometimes also simply known as Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation.\n\nEL can be split into two classes of approaches:\n* *End-to-End*: processing a piece of text to extract the entities (i.e. Named Entity Recognition) and then disambiguate these extracted entities to the correct entry in a given knowledge base (e.g. Wikidata, DBpedia, YAGO).\n* *Disambiguation-Only*: contrary to the first approach, this one directly takes gold standard named entities as input and only disambiguates them to the correct entry in a given knowledge base.\n\nExample:\n\n| Barack | Obama | was | born | in | Hawa\u00ef |\n| --- | ---| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama | O | O | O | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii |\n\nMore in details can be found in this [survey](http://dbgroup.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/wangjy/papers/TKDE14-entitylinking.pdf).",

They construct a type system, and use it to constrain the outputs of a neural network to respect the symbolic structure. They achieve this by reformulating the design problem into a mixed integer problem: create a type system and subsequently train a neural network with it. They propose a 2-step algorithm: 1) heuristic search or stochastic optimization over discrete variables that define a type system\ninformed by an Oracle and a Learnability heuristic, 2) gradient descent to fit classifier parameters. They apply DeepType to the problem of Entity Linking on three standard datasets (i.e. WikiDisamb30, CoNLL (YAGO), TAC KBP 2010) and find that it outperforms all existing solutions by a wide margin, including approaches that rely on a human-designed type system or recent deep learning-based entity embeddings, while explicitly using symbolic information lets it integrate new entities without retraining.",

            "description": "Evaluating Entity Linking systems in a manner that allows for direct comparison of performance can be difficult. The precise definition of a \"correct\" annotation can be somewhat subjective and it is easy to make mistakes. To provide a simple example, given the input surface form **\"Tom Waits\"**, an evaluation dataset might record the dbpedia resource `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tom_Waits` as the correct referent. Yet an annotation system which returns a reference to `http://dbpedia.org/resource/PEHDTSCKJBMA` has technically provided an appropriate annotation as this resource is a redirect to `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tom_Waits`. Alternatively if evaluating an End-to-End EL system, then accuracy with respect to word boundaries must be considered e.g. if a system only annotates **\"Obama\"** with the URI `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barack_Obama` in the surface form **\"Barack Obama\"**, then is the system correct or incorrect in its annotation?\n\nFurthermore, the performance of an EL system can be strongly affected by the nature of the content on which the evaluation is performed e.g. news content versus Tweets. Hence comparing the relative performance of two EL systems which have been tested on two different corpora can be fallicious. Rather than allowing these little subjective points to creep into the evaluation of EL systems, it is better to make use of a standard evaluation platform where these assumptions are known and made explicit in the configuration of the experiment.\n\n[GERBIL][GERBIL], developed by [AKSW][AKSW] is an evaluation platform that is based on the [BAT framework][Cornolti]. It defines a number of standard experiments which may be run for any given EL service. These experiment types determine how strict the evaluation is with respect to measures such as word boundary alignment and also dictates how much responsibility is assigned to the EL service with respect to Entity Recognition, etc. GERBIL hosts 38 evaluation datasets obtained from a variety of different EL challenges. At present it also has hooks for 17 different EL services which may be included in an experiment.\n\nGERBIL may be used to test your own EL system either by downloading the source code and deploying GERBAL locally, or by making your service available on the web and giving GERBIL a link to your API endpoint. The only condition is that your API must accept input and respond with output in [NIF][NIF] format. It is also possible to upload your own evaluation dataset if you would like to test these services on your own content. Note the dataset must also be in NIF format. The [DBpedia Spotlight evaluation dataset][SpotlightEvaluation] is a good example of how to structure your content.\n\nGERBIL does have a number of shortcomings, the most notable of which are:\n1. There is no way to view the annotations returned by each system you test. These are handled internally by GERBIL and then discarded. This can make it difficult to determine the source of error with an EL system.\n2. There is no way to observe the candidate list considered for each surface form. This is, of course, a standard problem with any third party EL API, but if one is conducting a detailed investigation into the performance of an EL system, it is important to know if the source of error was the EL algorithm itself, or the candidate retrieval process which failed to identify the correct referent as a candidate. This was listed as an important consideration by [Hachey et al][Hachey].\n\nNevertheless, GERBIL is an excellent resource for standardising how EL systems are tested and compared. It is also a good starting point for anyone new to Entity Linking as it contains links to a wide variety of EL resources.

These relations include *born-in*, *nationality*, *is-in* (for geographical entities), *part-of* (for organizations, among others), and more.\n* *Semantic Graphs*: SGs such as [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) are often manually-curated resources of semantic concepts, restricted to more \"linguistic\" relations compared to free real-world knowledge. The most common semantic relation is *hypernym*, also known as the *is-a* relation (example: \\<*cat*, *hypernym*, *feline*\\>).",

The evaluation criterion is Pearson correlation.\n\nThe SICK relatedness (SICK-R) task trains a linear model to output a score from 1 to 5 indicating the relatedness of two sentences. For\nthe same dataset (SICK-E) can be treated as a three-class classification problem using the entailment labels (classes are 'entailment', 'contradiction', and 'neutral').\nThe evaluation metric for SICK-R is Pearson correlation and classification accuracy for SICK-E.\n\nThe Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC) corpus is a paraphrase identification dataset, where systems\naim to identify if two sentences are paraphrases of each other.

These annotations are over a large number of tokens, a broad cross-section of domains, and 3 languages (English, Arabic, and Chinese). The NER dataset (of interest here) includes 18 tags, consisting of 11 _types_ (PERSON, ORGANIZATION, etc) and 7 _values_ (DATE, PERCENT, etc), and contains 2 million tokens.
